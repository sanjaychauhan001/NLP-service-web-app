I've developed a Flask-based web application that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide users with powerful text analysis tools. to analyze the text i have used API of paralleldots. also connected the registration and login page with MYSQL.
Here's what it offers:

User Registration and Authentication:
Implemented secure user registration and login functionalities to ensure data privacy and access control.
User information is stored in a MySQL database for seamless cross-checking.

Named Entity Recognition (NER): 
Utilized an NLP API to identify and extract entities such as names, organizations, and locations from user input. 
This feature aids in understanding the context and key entities within the text.

Sentiment Analysis: Integrated sentiment analysis capabilities to determine the emotional tone of the text, providing insights into user sentiments and opinions.

Abuse Detection: Implemented abuse detection functionality to identify and flag potentially abusive or offensive language within the text. This feature promotes a safer and more respectful online environment.

By combining these functionalities, the application empowers users to gain valuable insights from text data, whether it's for business intelligence, social media monitoring, or personal use.![Screenshot 2024-05-04 163000](https://github.com/sanjaychauhan001/NLP-service-web-app/assets/131572534/8ade4b8e-c3f7-406c-b41d-2c11d59478a3)
